# ASR and Translation Subtitles Project

This project generates subtitles from audio using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with Whisper and translates them using the LLMs.


## To-Do List

- Timestamp (under chunked mode) occasionally to be not correct, check and fix if possible.
- Sentence divisions (under chunked mode) are not good, try to refined it with LLMs.
- Translation results are bad given with small model.
- GUI required (considier to use streamlit for deployment).
- Show the process with log files.
- Inference accelaration (batch inference and so on).
